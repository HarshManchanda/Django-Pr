Django Tutorial

Commands:

1) django-admin startproject <project_name> : create a folder with <project name> specified

2) Files that are created in project_name folder are 
	* __init__.py : to read folder structure. To import or export files in the project folder
	* asgi.py : asynchronous gateway interface
	* settings.py :  to add all the settings
	* urls.py : to map all the urls
	* wsgi.py :  webserver gateway interface

3) App creation:
	* python manage.py startapp <app_name>
	* Apps are basically created for making various functionalities for eg: If we need an accounts section/module in our projects we will create another app with same command above. 
	* apps have various files in it:
		- folder-> migrations
		- __init__.py : to read folder structure. To import or export files in the project folder
		- admin.py : django inbuilt admin panel, to change or modify it
		- apps.py 
		- models.py : related to database for entire app
		- tests.py
		- views.py : logical part [imp : for data to send from backend to frontend]


Note: When we create a new app we must have to add it to settings.py in INSTALLED_APPS list.
 

4) python manage.py runserver : To run server locally

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:

views.py: Its the logical part where we write our logics and code. There are two types of views Class Based Views and Function Based Views.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

models.py : define schema for database

5) python manage.py makemigrations: 
	- This command will create migration file.
	- First migration file that is generated has a name 0001_initial.py. After that 	when we make any changes in our models.py file and again run this command, then 	each time a new file with 0002_[action_name].py will be generated.
	- Most imported fields in migration files are "dependencies" and "operations"

6) python manage.py migrate: this command will update the database, checks for any deleted file.

	- django throws error if somefile is present in database but is deleted from the project.
	- IMP QUESTION: HOW DJANGO KNOWS THAT THEIR IS SOME FILE MISSING FROM THE PROJECT?
	- ANS: Whenever we enter the above command the django runs all the migration files and create a new state, then it matches this state with state that is present in the database; if some fields are to be updated or removed then that work will be executed, if nothing to be updated then no change takes place and if some file is deleted in current state but present in previous database state, then it gives error.

ORM ->

1. order_by(): to sort query into ascending or descending order. If field with -ve sign then descending else by default ascending. For example:
>>> vege = Recipe.objects.all().order_by('recipe_view_count')
>>> vege
<QuerySet [<Recipe: Recipe object (5)>, <Recipe: Recipe object (1)>]>
>>> vege = Recipe.objects.all().order_by('-recipe_view_count')
>>> vege
<QuerySet [<Recipe: Recipe object (1)>, <Recipe: Recipe object (5)>]>

2. Limit: As if db consist of 100s of records then query can be big. So we can use limit by using slicing. For eg:
>>> vege = Recipe.objects.all().order_by('recipe_view_count')[0:1]
>>> vege
<QuerySet [<Recipe: Recipe object (5)>]>

3. filter: filter is used for filtering out query. for eg, if I want to view recipe who has views >=20 then we can use below code:
>>> from vege.models import *
>>> Recipe.objects.all()[0].recipe_view_count
21
>>> Recipe.objects.all()[1].recipe_view_count 
14
# Here gte is inbuilt django terminology as when we use filter, we can add these remarks after field by leaving __ between them. There are various other types of these remarks like iscontain, iexact, lte, etc.
>>> Recipe.objects.filter(recipe_view_count__gte = 20) 
<QuerySet [<Recipe: Recipe object (1)>]>

------

Advance ORM Query:

- startswith : to filterout string starting with a given substring

In [7]: queryset = Student.objects.filter(student_name__startswith
   ...:  = "ap")

In [8]: queryset
Out[8]: <QuerySet [<Student: April Villarreal>]>

- endswith : to filter out string ends with a given substring

In [7]: queryset = Student.objects.filter(student_name__startswith
   ...:  = "ap")

In [8]: queryset
Out[8]: <QuerySet [<Student: April Villarreal>]>

- icontains : to filter out string if given substring present in the string

In [26]: queryset = Student.objects.filter(student_name__icontains = "A
    ...: n")

In [27]: queryset
Out[27]: <QuerySet [<Student: Alexander Cobb>, <Student: Amanda Davis>, <Student: Amanda Faulkner>, <Student: Andrew Gill>, <Student: Angelica Graham>, <Student: Brian Berry>, <Student: Cheryl Daniel>, <Student: Christine Frank>, <Student: Daniel Gutierrez>, <Student: Daniel Young>, <Student: Diana Fitzpatrick>, <Student: Dustin Beltran>, <Student: Elizabeth Manning>, <Student: Hannah Carlson>, <Student: Heather Morgan>, <Student: Jennifer Hernandez>, <Student: Jonathan Salinas>, <Student: Kelly Sherman>, <Student: Patrick Duran>, <Student: Randy Greene>, '...(remaining elements truncated)...']>

- If we want to access foreign key, for example we are using department in our Student model, and department is a foreign key as we have created another model namely Department for it. let say we have some other fields in department that we want to access through Student model department, we can simply do it for example:
- let say we have department field in Department model for each department

In [30]: queryset = Student.objects.all()
In [32]: queryset[0]
Out[32]: <Student: Alexander Cobb>

In [33]: queryset[0].department
Out[33]: <Department: Finance>

In [34]: queryset[0].department.department #here we are accessing department's department
Out[34]: 'Finance'

Similarly, if we have date_of_estabilish field in Department model, then we can simply write -> queryset[0].department.date_of_estabilish and this will give us year.

- Another thing, we always use '__' or double underscore in filter in django because its inbuilt django convention that it automatically understand that before this is a field or a foreign key and after this must be a inbuilt function or foreign key fieldname. For eg:

In [35]: queryset = Student.objects.filter(department__department = 'Ci
    ...: vil')

In [36]: queryset
Out[36]: <QuerySet [<Student: Alexis Davis>, <Student: Amanda Faulkner>, <Student: Amy Flores>, <Student: Andrew Gill>, <Student: April Villarreal>, <Student: Ashley Lewis>, <Student: Barbara Olson>, <Student: Chris Palmer>, <Student: Christine Frank>, <Student: Eric Henderson>, <Student: Heather Morgan>, <Student: Jay Miller>, <Student: Joe Potter>, <Student: Jonathan Salinas>, <Student: Kristen Gonzalez>, <Student: Leah Thornton>, <Student: Lisa Henry>, <Student: Mark Watson>, <Student: Mary Johnson>, <Student: Melissa Frazier>, '...(remaining elements truncated)...']>

# In above we can see that by using '__' double underscore after foreign key department and filter out those department those are from Civil.

In [37]: queryset = Student.objects.filter(department__department__icon
    ...: tains = 'Civ')

In [38]: queryset.count()
Out[38]: 30

- In django orm, there can be __in just like __icontains, __in can be used to filter out data that are matching with a data in a list.

- exclude : This can be used to filterout records by excluding some value. Student.objects.exclude(...)

In [39]: queryset = Student.objects.exclude(department__department = 'C
    ...: ivil')

In [40]: queryset.count()
Out[40]: 71


- There various other methods in django orm, refer to documentation.
